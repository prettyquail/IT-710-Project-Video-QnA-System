YUFENG GUO: The world is filled
with data, a lot of data--

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.980
pictures, music, words,
spreadsheets, videos, and it

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.370
doesn't look like it's going
to slow down anytime soon.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.110
Machine learning
brings the promise

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.320
of deriving meaning
from all of that data.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.840
Arthur C. Clarke
famously once said,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.910
"Any sufficiently
advanced technology is

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.860
indistinguishable from magic."

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.770
I found machine learning
not to be magic,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.170
but rather tools and
technology that you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.620
can utilize to answer
questions with your data.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.660
This is Cloud AI Adventures.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.090
My name is Yufeng
Guo, and each episode,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.440
we will be exploring
the art, science,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.710
and tools of machine learning.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.840
Along the way, we'll
see just how easy

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.240
it is to create
amazing experiences

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.850
and yield valuable insights.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.590
The value of machine
learning is only

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.210
just beginning to show itself.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.700
There is a lot of data in
the world today generated

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.570
not only by people, but
also by computers, phones

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.840
and other devices.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.260
This will only continue to
grow in the years to come.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.630
Traditionally, humans
have analyzed data

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.960
and adapted systems to the
changes in data patterns.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.780
However, as the volume
of data surpasses

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.970
the ability for humans
to make sense of it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.040
and manually write
those rules, we

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.770
will turn increasingly
to automated systems that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.150
can learn from the
data and importantly,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.290
the changes in data to adapt
to a shifting landscape.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.960
We see machine
learning all around us

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.700
in the products we use today.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.890
However, it isn't
always apparent

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.410
that machine learning
is behind it all.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.400
While things like tagging
objects and people inside

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.364
of photos are clearly
machine learning at play,

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.780
it may not be
immediately apparent

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.970
that recommending the
next video to watch

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.940
is also powered by
machine learning.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.220
Of course, perhaps the
biggest example of all

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.600
is Google search.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.520
Every time you
use Google search,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.250
you're using a system that has
many machine learning systems

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.460
at its core, from understanding
the text of your query

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.790
to adjusting the results based
on your personal interests,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.090
such as knowing which results
to show you first when searching

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.120
for Java depending on whether
you're a coffee expert

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.560
or a developer--
perhaps you're both.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.220
Today, machine learning's
immediate applications

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.730
are already quite wide-ranging,
including image recognition,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.070
fraud detection and
recommendation systems,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.890
as well as text and
speech systems too.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.720
These powerful
capabilities can be

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.790
applied to a wide
range of fields,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.930
from diabetic retinopathy and
skin cancer detection to retail

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.760
and of course,
transportation in the form

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.300
of self-parking and
self-driving vehicles.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.630
It wasn't that long ago that
when a company or product had

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.490
machine learning
in its offerings,

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.530
it was considered novel.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.590
Now, every company is pivoting
to use machine learning

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.690
in their products in some way.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.920
It's rapidly becoming,
well, an expected feature.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.570
Just as we expect companies
to have a website that

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.480
works on your mobile
device or perhaps an app,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.520
the day will soon
come when it will

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.530
be expected that
our technology will

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.030
be personalized, insightful
and self-correcting.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.930
As we use machine learning to
make human tasks better, faster

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.790
and easier than
before, we can also

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.160
look further into the
future when machine learning

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.900
can help us do
tasks that we never

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.270
could have achieved on our own.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.250
Thankfully, it's not
hard to take advantage

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.900
of machine learning today.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.700
The tooling has
gotten quite good.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.460
All you need is data,
developers and a willingness

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.810
to take the plunge.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.030
For our purposes, I've
shortened the definition

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.760
of machine learning down
to just five words--

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.714
using data to answer questions.

00:03:32.714 --> 00:03:34.380
While I wouldn't use
such a short answer

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.890
for an essay prompt on exam, it
serves a useful purpose for us

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.640
here.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.780
In particular, we can split
the definition into two parts--

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.480
using data and answer questions.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.600
These two pieces broadly
outline the two sides

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.910
in machine learning, both
of them equally important.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.910
Using data is what we
refer to as training,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.910
while answering questions
is referred to as making

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.440
predictions or inference.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.240
Now let's drill into those two
sides briefly for a little bit.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.310
Training refers
to using our data

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.640
to inform the creation and fine
tuning of a predictive model.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.190
This predictive
model can then be

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.090
used to serve up predictions
on previously unseen data

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.100
and answer those questions.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.870
As more data is
gathered, the model

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.220
can be improved over time and
new predictive models deployed.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.350
As you may have noticed,
the key component

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.380
of this entire process is data.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.630
Everything hinges on data.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.480
Data is the key to unlocking
machine learning, just

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.630
as much as machine learning
is the key to unlocking

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.180
that hidden insight in data.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.710
This was just a
high level overview

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.300
of machine learning--
why it's useful

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.340
and some of its applications.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.930
Machine learning
is a broad field,

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.910
spanning an entire
family of techniques when

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.480
inferring answers from data.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.540
So in future episodes,
we'll aim to give you

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.340
a better sense of
what approaches

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.190
to use for a given
data set and question

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.010
you want to answer, as well
as provide the tools for how

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.860
to accomplish it.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.780
In our next episode,
we'll dive right

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.360
into the concrete process
of doing machine learning

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.650
in more detail, going through
a step-by-step formula for how

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.570
to approach machine
learning problems.
