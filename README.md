# IT-710-Project-Video-QnA-System

## About:
The aim of our project is that we want to perform a semantic search on videos in a computationally efficient manner with the help of the URL provided by the user and to solve all the problems identified by making a simple tool. This project focuses on new techniques and approaches to develop a video question answering system.
